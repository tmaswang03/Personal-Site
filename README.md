# Personal-Site
This project was made with ReactJS as well as Tailwind CSS and Styled Components. Pretty much everything about me can be located on my site. Currently, I am still editing and updating the site as I go. The site can be found at https://tmaswang04.ca, deployed using Github Pages. 

To run the project locally, download the repository and run a development server using 
```
npm start 
```
The result can then be seen on http://localhost:3000 with the browser of your choice.
