                Hey guys, as you probably know my name is Thomas Wang.
                I'm currently a grade 12 student attending the IB program at Milliken Mills High School. 
                Some subjects that I am most passionate about are Mathematics, Computer Science (web dev + competitive programming), 
                as well as Music.
